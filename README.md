📁 GNN-Based Feature Selection for ECG Classification (MIT-BIH)

# 💡 GNN-Based Feature Selection for ECG Classification

This project focuses on the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Graph Attention Networks (GAT), for interpretable feature selection in ECG signal classification using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. Our method extracts ECG features, models their relationships as a graph, ranks them using attention scores, and evaluates downstream classification using machine learning models.

## 📚 Dataset

* MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (PhysioNet)
* 48 annotated ECG recordings, 2 channels per recording
* Sampling rate: 360 Hz
* Each beat is annotated and categorized (e.g., N: Normal, V: Ventricular, S: Supraventricular, F: Fusion, Q: Unknown)

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing

* Baseline wander removal (high-pass filtering)
* Powerline interference suppression (notch filter at 50/60 Hz)
* High-frequency noise reduction (low-pass filtering)
* R-peak detection (Pan-Tompkins or bioSPPy)
* Normalization and beat segmentation

---

## 🧠 Feature Extraction

Features extracted include:

* Morphological: QRS duration, P-wave, T-wave amplitude, ST-segment
* HRV-based: RR intervals, SDNN, RMSSD, PNN50, LF/HF ratio
* Time-domain: R-peak amplitude, beat duration
* Frequency-domain: Wavelet coefficients (Daubechies), FFT bands
* Others: Signal entropy, area under curve

---

## 🔗 Graph Construction

* Nodes = ECG features
* Edges = Feature correlations (Pearson / Mutual Information) or domain-defined
* Fully connected graph or thresholded edges based on similarity
